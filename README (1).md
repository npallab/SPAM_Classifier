# Spam Classifier Using Random Forest Regression



## Overview:
This project is a spam classification system built using a Kaggle dataset and deployed via Gradio. The classifier uses a Random Forest Regression model to identify spam messages effectively.

**Features**

Model: Random Forest Regression
Dataset: Spam dataset downloaded from Kaggle
Deployment: Gradio-powered web interface for easy interaction

## How it works:
  
**Dataset Preprocessing:**

Loaded and cleaned the Kaggle dataset.
Performed text preprocessing such as tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.
Model Training:

Trained a Random Forest Regression model to classify messages.
Evaluated the model using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Deployment:

Built a Gradio interface to allow users to interact with the classifier
